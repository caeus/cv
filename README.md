## Experience

### Software Architect
#### Foodology Inc
##### Sep 2021 - Present
Foodology is a company that specializes in managing and operating cloud kitchens, offering diverse culinary experiences for online food delivery.

**Responsabilities:**
* Design high level system architecture to meet project requirements and ensuring scalability and reliability.
* Provide guidance and direction to development teams, oversee code quality, and conduct code reviews.
* Evaluate and choose appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools for project development.
* Maintain technical documentation, collaborate with stakeholders, and ensure alignment between technical and business objectives.
* Continuously seek improvements, conduct proofs of concept, address technical challenges, and stay current with emerging technologies to drive innovation.

**Achievements:**

* Spearheaded a groundbreaking transformation of a sluggish, poorly structured monolithic software system into a dynamic, distributed architecture. The reimagined design championed separation of concerns, data integrity, and exceptional performance.
* Pioneered the implementation of a unified monorepo and end-to-end Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, fostering hassle-free deployments, dependable pull request testing, and seamless code sharing across services.
* Championed the dissemination of best practices through engaging teaching sessions on topics like testing, functional programming, naming conventions, and architecture. Elevated junior developers to senior levels of performance, establishing a culture of excellence.
* Unleashed the potential of a distributed model, resulting in a significant boost in scalability and unwavering system reliability, translating to substantial productivity gains. This transformation, partly empowered by Kubernetes (k8s), made infrastructure management more code-centric through Infrastructure as Code (IaC), reducing manual intervention and enhancing overall reliability
* Developed a Menu Management System to efficiently handle menus for thousands of virtual stores across various food delivery platforms, simplifying operations and ensuring menu consistency.
