## Summary
Seasoned software engineer and architect with over a decade of experience building dependable solutions. With a systematic, thorough and principled mindset to problem-solving I meticulously construct domain models from which future-proof and highly reliable solutions naturally emerge. I take on a leadership role in guiding and mentoring teams for the development of top-tier software and for their future as engineers. My work consistently elevates teams productivity and enhances critical aspects of the software development cycle, including scalability, maintainability and flexibility.

I excel in mentoring cross-functional teams, ensuring alignment, and navigating agile methodologies. I possess a strong foundation in software architectural patterns, particularly for event-driven microservices in distributed systems. I'm highly knowledgeable and proficient in functional programming paradigms, and I adhere to a strict clean code philosophy. I have a deep mastery of JVM languages such as Scala, Kotlin, and Java, I'm proficient in JavaScript (and TypeScript) and more (including Python and Golang). My experience covers a broad range of databases, including relational (Postgres, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Redis). I'm well-versed in Git for version control and have extensive experience with leading cloud providers, notably AWS and GCP. I've gained hands-on expertise with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
